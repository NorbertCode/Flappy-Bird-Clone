# Flappy-Bird-Clone
A flappy bird clone I created back in 2018. It was made for school, so all variables, methods, etc. are named in Polish. Other than that there are some weird decisions, but the code mostly works.

This uses the SFML library, so you need to link it to your compiler. The entire library is included in this project in `/Flappy Bird/resources/SFML-2.5.1`
